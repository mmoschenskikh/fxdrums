overview=FXDrums, 2020 \nThis little program with GUI is made as the Task 3 of the second semester at SPBPU. It is made following object-oriented programming paradigm and the MVC pattern. The programming language is Java, and JavaFX is used to implement the user interface.
controls=There are two ways to make drums sound. \nThe first is to just click their images with any of your mouse's buttons. \nThe second way is to use keyboard to play drums. The binds are following:\nB — Kick;\nV — Snare;\nC — Hi-Hat;\nD — Crash;\nH — Tom;\nJ — Ride;\nN — Floor Tom.\nIf you want to change the volume of any single drum, go File -> Mixer to do that.\nDrum Machine (File -> Drum Machine) able to play, save and load drum patterns.
sound_types=Two sources of sound are available: MIDI and .wav files.\nMIDI is usually built-in and can be used OOB, but the sounds differ for each PC. Also there are a noticeable delay.\nSo, .wav sounds are faster. To use .wav files you must have a "sounds" directory in your program directory. "sounds/" must contain the following files:\n"36.wav" for Kick;\n"38.wav" for Snare;\n"42.wav" for Hi-Hat;\n"55.wav" for Crash;\n"47.wav" for Tom;\n"51.wav" for Ride;\n"41.wav" for Floor Tom.\nIf any single file is missing, you will not be able to use the .wav option.
